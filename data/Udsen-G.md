## USING ***PRIVATE*** RATHER THAN ***PUBLIC*** FOR CONSTANTS, SAVES GAS

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where itâ€™s used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table
